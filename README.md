> *:warning: The library is now at the beta stage. Any implementations in projects are welcome.

## Highlights

* The library does not have dependencies (polyfilled code depends on *@babel/runtime* to avoid
  duplications).
* It ensures the performance to be at least on the same level as the popular state management
  libraries for *React*, e. g. *Redux*, *Recoil*.
* It has a small size.
* It is heavily tested (more than 40 tests performed on the source code as well as on bundled code).
* It is written with the use of the standard React hooks only, thus ensures better compatibility.
* It is written in *TypeScript* and typed the way the error messages are [speaking the human
  language](docs/UseWithTypeScript.md#error-messages) (ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥ðŸ™ˆ *You will love it!*).
* The logic of the *use-interstate* library is aligned and synchronized with the natural life cycles
  of *React* components which make the use and feeling similar to the standard *React* hook
  `useState` .
* It does not require having a *Context Provider* at the root of the component tree of an
  application, thus ensures [better security for
  applications](docs/SecurityNotes.md#why-not-context-provider).
* It is agnostic to application architecture, so one can use the library adopting either redux-like
  paradigm with actions, reducers, and selectors, state machine, or use it simply as an "interstate"
  variant of the standard `useState` hook which is great for prototyping and creating proofs of
  concepts.
